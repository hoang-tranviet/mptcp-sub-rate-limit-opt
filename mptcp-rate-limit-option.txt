1.  Introduction

   Multipath TCP [RFC6824] [I-D.ietf-mptcp-rfc6824bis] is used in
   various use cases [RFC8040].  In several situations, a Multipath TCP
   host would like its peer to limit the sending rate over a subflow.

   It is common that the mobile clients have a limited cellular data
   subscription.  Even if this is not the case, mobile network operators
   may still silently throttle the networking capacity of those
   customers who have used up a large amount of cellular data.  As the
   time of this writing, a good LTE or 5G connection running at full
   speed in a few hour could squeze all monthly budget cellular quota.
   A common scenario is that the mobile users want to limit the monetary
   cost of using cellular networks or to avoid running out of the mobile
   data quota.  However, most of the traffic are down-streamed - on
   which the clients cannot control directly.  For this, the clients
   would desire the servers to limit the maximum throughput on the
   cellular network subflow.  This is more important when the mobile
   clients are roaming abroad where the monetary cost for cellular data
   is usually very high.

   As discussed on the multipathtcp IETF mailling list [99], this rate-
   control mechanism can also be used when a client wants to tell a
   sender to close a subflow gracefully by requesting the zero transfer
   rate.  Though the client may send a TCP-RST on this subflow instead,
   in-flight data would be lost and must be reinjected over other
   subflows.  Another solution is to send an MP_PRIO option to the
   sender to put the cellular subflow into backup mode, but this request
   could be overriden by the sender's local policy.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

3.  The Multipath TCP Subflow Rate Limit (SRL) Option

3.1.  Option Format

   The format of the SRL option is depicted in Fig. Figure 1:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +---------------+---------------+-------+-------+---------------+
      |     Kind      |  Length = 5   |Subtype| (rsv) | Requested Rate|
      +---------------+---------------+-------+-------+---------------+
      |       Requested Rate                          |
      +-----------------------------------------------+


             Figure 1: MPTCP Subflow Rate Limit Option Format

   In the SRL option, the Requested Rate (32 bits) is specified in IEEE
   754 binary32 format (single-precision binary floating-point format).
   The same format has been used in [RFC3630] to specify the maximum
   bandwidth.  This format is as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |S|    Exponent   |                  Fraction                   |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                      Figure 2: IEEE binary32 format

   : Sign bit (1 bit).  MUST be set to zero.  Exponent (8 bits) is the
      exponent base 2 in "excess 127" notation.

      Fraction (23 bits) is the mantissa - 1, with an implied binary
      point in front of it.

   Thus, the above represents the value:

     (-1)**(S) * 2**(Exponent-127) * (1 + Fraction)

   The unit of this value is Kilobits per second (Kbps).

3.2.  SRL Option and Local Policies

   Note that the SRL option is an indicative value.  Upon reception of
   this option, the receiver MAY choose to set the maximum rate on the
   same subflow.

   Like all Multipath TCP options, the SRL Option is exchanged without
   any protection from TCP's reliability mechanisms.  Therefore,
   implementations MUST NOT assume that it is transferred reliably.
   Implementations that use the SRL option can transmit the SRL option
   at any time.  Since the utilisation of this option is not negotiated
   during the connection handshake, a host MUST NOT send more than three
   SRL options on a connection where it has not received any SRL option.

4.  Implementation and Interoperability

   If TCP Pacing is supported, implementations MAY use this mechanism to
   implement the rate control.

5.  Security Considerations

   Since the SRL option is neither encrypted nor authenticated, on-path
   attackers and middleboxes could remove, add or modify the SRL option
   on observed Multipath TCP connections.  However, the incentive of
   manipulating this option is unclear.

   For example, an on-path middle man may insert an option to throttle
   the rate on a subflow to nearly zero, effectively stall the subflow.
   However, if an attacker has that capability, it could instead drop
   all packets or inject the TCP-RST/MPTCP-FASTCLOSE.

   On the other hand, the on-path middlebox may increase the rate-limit
   value in the exchanged option to a very high value.  This effectively
   has the same effect as filtering out the option.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a MPTCP option subtype for the SRL option
   from the "MPTCP Option Subtypes" available at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/tcp-parameters/tcp-parameters.xhtml
