1.  Introduction

   Multipath TCP [RFC6824] [I-D.ietf-mptcp-rfc6824bis] is used in
   various use cases [RFC8040].  In several situations, a Multipath TCP
   host would like its peer to limit the sending rate over a specific
   subflow.

   It is common for mobile clients to have limited cellular data
   subscription.  Even if this is not the case, mobile network operators
   may still silently throttle the networking capacity of the customers
   who have used up a large amount of cellular data.  A good LTE or 5G
   connection running at full speed during less than a few hours could
   consume the entire monthly budget cellular quota of many users.  This
   is even more important when the mobile clients are roaming abroad
   where the monetary cost for cellular data can be very high.  A common
   scenario is that mobile users want to limit the monetary cost of
   using cellular networks or to avoid running out of their mobile data
   quota.  Smartphones can easily rate limit their upstream bandwidth,
   but unfortunately, most smartphone applications mainly receive data.
   For these applications, a rate limit must happen on the server side.
   This rate limit could be enforced by the application, e.g. by
   selecting a specific video coding scheme, but applying it at the
   transport layer would be more generic and could be done from the
   system level automatically.

   As discussed on the multipathtcp IETF mailing list
   [paasch_mptcpwg_2019], this rate-control mechanism can also be used
   when a client wants to inform a server to close a subflow gracefully
   by requesting a zero transfer rate.  Though the client may send a
   TCP-RST on this subflow instead, in-flight data would be lost and
   must be reinjected over other subflows.  Another solution is to send
   an MP_PRIO option to the sender to put the cellular subflow into

   backup mode, but this request could be overridden by the sender's
   local policy.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

3.  The Multipath TCP Subflow Rate Limit (SRL) Option

   This document proposes a Subflow Rate Limit option that indicates a
   maximum receive rate for the subflow it is sent.  Like other MPTCP
   options, this option is not sent reliably.  Hosts SHOULD resend it
   several times, but not more frequently than once per second.

3.1.  Option Format

   The format of the SRL option is depicted in Fig. Figure 1:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +---------------+---------------+-------+-------+---------------+
      |     Kind      |  Length = 7   |Subtype| (rsv) | Requested Rate|
      +---------------+---------------+-------+-------+---------------+
      |       Requested Rate                          |
      +-----------------------------------------------+


             Figure 1: MPTCP Subflow Rate Limit Option Format

   All reserved bits MUST be set to zero.

   In the SRL option, the Requested Rate (32 bits) is specified in IEEE
   754 binary32 format (single-precision binary floating-point format).
   The same format is used in [RFC3630] to specify the maximum bandwidth
   of a link.  This format is as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |S|    Exponent   |                  Fraction                   |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                      Figure 2: IEEE binary32 format

   o  Sign bit (1 bit) MUST be set to zero.

   o  Exponent (8 bits) is the exponent base 2 in "excess 127" notation.

   o  Fraction (23 bits) is the mantissa - 1, with an implied binary
      point in front of it.

   Thus, the above represents the value:

     (-1)**(S) * 2**(Exponent-127) * (1 + Fraction)

   The unit of this value is Kilobits per second (Kbps).

3.2.  SRL Option and Local Policies

   Note that the SRL option is an indicative value.  Upon reception of
   this option, the receiver SHOULD set the maximum rate on the subflow
   over which the option was received.

   Like all Multipath TCP options, the SRL Option is exchanged without
   any protection from TCP's reliability mechanisms.  Therefore,
   implementations MUST NOT assume that it is transferred reliably.
   Implementations that use the SRL option can transmit the SRL option
   at any time.  Since the utilisation of this option is not negotiated
   during the connection handshake, a host MUST NOT send more than three
   SRL options on a connection where it has not received any SRL option.

4.  Implementation and Interoperability

   Implementations MAY use various mechanisms to implement the rate
   control policy, for example using TCP Pacing or clamping the subflow
   congestion window.  For old implementations that are unaware of this
   option, they should ignore when receive unknown MPTCP options, as
   specified in [RFC6824] and [I-D.ietf-mptcp-rfc6824bis].

5.  Security Considerations

   Since the SRL option is neither encrypted nor authenticated, on-path
   attackers and middleboxes could remove, add or modify the SRL option
   on observed Multipath TCP connections.  However, manipulating this
   option doing not open new attacks compared to the ones documented in
   [RFC6181] [RFC7430].

   For example, an on-path middle man could insert an option to throttle
   the rate on a subflow to nearly zero, effectively stalling the
   subflow.  However, if an attacker has that capability, it could
   instead drop all packets or inject the TCP-RST/MP-FASTCLOSE.

   On the other hand, on-path middleboxes may increase the rate-limit
   value in the exchanged option to a very high value.  This effectively
   has the same effect as filtering out the option.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an MPTCP option subtype for the SRL
   option from the "MPTCP Option Subtypes" available at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/tcp-parameters/tcp-parameters.xhtml
